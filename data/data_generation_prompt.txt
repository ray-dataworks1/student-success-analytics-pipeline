Create a detailed, synthetic dataset for an EdTech platform that tracks learner progress, engagement, and outcomes. The dataset should focus on:

Learner Demographics:

Student ID

Age

Gender

Learning Disabilities (ND/Non-ND)

Enrollment Date

Subscription Type (free/premium)

Learner Activity:

Quiz Session Date

Quiz ID

Quiz Topic/Subject

Quiz Score

Time Spent on Quiz

Flashcards Used (Yes/No)

Flashcard Accuracy (score)

Total Active Sessions (weekly)

Session Duration

Device Used (Mobile/Desktop)

Learning Outcomes:

Cumulative Learning Progress (%) per learner

Percentage of Correct Answers in Specific Topics

Retention Rate (weekly, monthly)

Time to Master Key Concepts

User Feedback & Sentiment:

Satisfaction Rating (1-5)

Feedback Type (bug/feature request/suggestion)

Date of Feedback

Comments/Sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)

The dataset should be clean, contain realistic patterns (such as variation in scores, frequent quiz-takers vs. infrequent ones, and different ND/non-ND learner outcomes). It should have at least 500 learners with 2-3 months of activity data, and feature diverse learning journeys, especially for ND learners. Create mock data that I can use to analyze learning outcomes, user engagement, and identify potential areas for improvement in the product.
